**The [10th International Workshop on Eye Movements in Programming](/workshop/emip-2022/) will take place May 18, 2022 virtually at the [44th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2022)](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2022).**

Programming education and practice mainly focus on writing code, while the reading skills are often taken for granted. Reading occurs in debugging, maintenance and the learning of programming languages. It provides the essential basis for comprehension. By analyzing behavioral data such as gaze during code reading processes, we explore this essential part of programming.

It was co-located with the [2023 ACM Symposium of Eye Tracking Research & Applications (ETRA)](http://etra.acm.org/2023/).

**We are looking forward to a Twelfth edition of our workshop, likely to happen in Spring 2024.**

Programming education and practice mainly focus on writing code, while the reading skills are often taken for granted. Reading occurs in debugging, maintenance and the learning of programming languages. It provides the essential basis for comprehension. By analyzing behavioral data such as gaze during code reading processes, we explore this essential part of programming.

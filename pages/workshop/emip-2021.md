The Eighth International Workshop on Eye Movements in Programming (EMIP) will be held virtually on **May 27th 2021** from [3pm to 6pm (CEST)](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=EMIP+2021&iso=20210527T15&p1=317&ah=3). It is co-located with the [13th ACM Symposium on Eye Tracking Research and Applications (ETRA 2021)](http://etra.acm.org/2021/).

The study of eye gaze data has great potential for research in computer programming, computing education, and software engineering practice. The Eighth International Workshop on Eye Movements in Programming (EMIP 2021) will again focus on advancing the methodological, theoretical, and applied aspects of eye movements in programming. The goal of the workshop is to further develop the methodology of using eye gaze tracking for programming, both theoretically and in applications. What can gaze behavior tell us about cognitive processes during programming? This question enables us to understand the role of human factors involved in programming.

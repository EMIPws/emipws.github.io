## Keynote: Decoding the Codes in the Mind: Toward Elucidating the Computational Mechanisms of Intelligence in the Domain of Programming and Beyond

Abstract: 
Understanding how programmers perceive, comprehend, and internalize code offers a unique window into the broader mechanisms of human intelligence. In recent years, important progress has been made through empirical methodologies, including eye-tracking and brain imaging. To advance toward a principled understanding of cognitive processes in programming-related tasks, it is pivotal to integrate computational and mathematical perspectives, including AI-based approaches, alongside empirical insights.

In this keynote, I will present a series of studies investigating cognitive processes during code comprehension tasks. First, using brain imaging combined with machine learning techniques, we showed that neural activity patterns during code reading can predict the types of algorithms being considered, and found that programming expertise relates to distributed yet specific brain regions. Second, through eye-tracking analysis, we demonstrated that machine learning models trained on code representations can approximate programmers' gaze behavior, and that artificial agents imitating human gaze patterns achieve improved performance in code understanding tasks. Third, by applying graph-based neural network models to code, we observed that incorporating hierarchical representations significantly enhances task performance, suggesting that such structures are beneficial for capturing essential aspects of code comprehension. Building upon these foundations, our recent work has begun integrating physiological signals, such as heart rate variability, to capture richer dimensions of cognitive load and emotional dynamics during code comprehension. Inspired by emerging mind captioning techniques — which aim to translate brain activity into natural language descriptions — we explore the possibility of decoding programmers' internal mental representations during comprehension tasks. Separately, by analyzing the latent structures within code itself, analogous to the hidden syntactic and semantic patterns in natural language, we aim to clarify how these structures relate to the functional behavior of code. Through these interdisciplinary explorations, I argue that studying the cognitive processes underlying code comprehension offers a promising pathway toward elucidating the computational mechanisms of intelligence in the domain of programming and beyond.

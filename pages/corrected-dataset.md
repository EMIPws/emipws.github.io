In an effort to make the EMIP dataset more accessible and easier to use, Al Madi et al. presented a corrected token-level version of the EMIP dataset.

**Download:**

The corrected dataset can be [downloaded from the following link](https://osf.io/djn9s/)

# EMIP Toolkit

In addition to the corrected dataset, the paper presents EMIP Toolkit (EMTK), which is a **Python** library for customized post-processing of the EMIP dataset. EMTK implements the following features:
 
* Parsing raw data files from the EMIP dataset into Experiment, Trial, and Fixation containers.
* Customizable dispersion-based fixation detection algorithm implementation according to the manual of the SMI eye tracker used in the data collection.
* Raw data and filtered data visualizations for each trial.
* Performing hit testing between fixations and AOIs to determine the fixations over
each AOI.
* Customizable offset-based fixation correction implementation for each trial.
* Customizable Areas Of Interest (AOIs) mapping implementation at the line level
or token level in source code for each trial.
* Visualizing AOIs before and after fixations overlay on the code stimulus.
* Mapping source code tokens to generated AOIs and eye movement data.
* Adding source code lexical category tags to eye movement data using [srcML](https://www.srcml.org/). srcML is a static analysis tool and data format that provides very accurate syntactic categories (method signatures, parameters, function names, method calls, declarations and so on) for source code.

# EMIP Toolkit Download:

A stable version of the EMTK can be [downloaded through the replication package here](https://osf.io/djn9s/).

The replication package contains a Jupyter Notebook file "EMIP_Toolkit_Examples.ipynb" that contains examples and a tutorial on using the EMIP Toolkit. The latest development version of the [EMTK can be found here](https://github.com/nalmadi/EMIP-Toolkit).

Virtual event, November 29th - December 3rd, 2021

## Call for Participation
Stimulus design is an often acknowledged threat to validity when studying gaze in programming. This hands-on EMIP workshop focuses on how to design stimulus source codes and corresponding tasks for eye tracking studies in programming. We will also discuss pitfalls when devising stimuli and how to avoid them.

Prior to the workshop, participants will work on a warm-up task and prepare source codes and other stimulus material to discuss at the workshop. During the workshop week three synchronous meetings will take place on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, lasting about two to three hours. The times will be determined according to participants’ time zones.

Workshop results will be compiled into a report and we are aiming at a joint publication as with previous workshops, such as:
